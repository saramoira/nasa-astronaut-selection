# NASA Astronaut Selection: Exploratory Analysis
Saramoira Shields

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to analyze overall trends in NASA's astronaut selection process and specifically, the 2013 applicant pool in order to motivate a recommendation for future thorough analysis and modeling of potential biases in selection. 

## Design 
In January 2022 NASA’s OIG released an [audit report](https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-007.pdf) analyzing NASA’s current management of the of the Astronaut Corps. Among the major concerns listed was the current diversity of the Corps. The purpose of the proposed project is to identify biases in NASA’s selection process and to make a recommendation for changes to that process based on trends in education attainment among demographic groups in the US. I looked at the overal demographic makeup and career milestones for the current astronaut corps, as well as trends in educational attainment (specifically STEM degrees that NASA deems qualifying) among various demographic groups.  

## Data
* NASA’s [Astronaut Yearbook](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/astronaut-yearbook): I updated this file manually with selectee information and career milestones since this yearboook was created. 
* Anonymized applicant data from the [2013](https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Analysis_of_age_as_a_factor_in_NASA_astronaut_selection_and_career_landmarks/5252974?file=8981851) astronaut applicants.   
* NCES 2020 [education attainment report](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2020menu_tables.asp) and manually requested datasets tracking the awarding of NASA-qualifying STEM degrees in the US from 2010-2020 

## Algorithms/Tools
This project used Google Sheets for initial analysis, and then Excel for analysis of the larger datasets (2013 applicant data and NCES records of STEM Degrees awarded from 2010-2020). Tableau was used for final data visualization - dashboard is online at [NASA Astronaut Selection](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saramoira.shields/viz/NASAAstronautSelection/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
