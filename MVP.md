## Analysis NASA Astronaut selection

The goal of this project is to assess the NASA Astronaut candidate selection process from the viewpoint of diversity metrics (race/ethnicity, gender).

The chart below shows the percentage of active women and minorities in the NASA Astronaut Corps vs the general population - the representation of these groups in the Astronaut Corps is consistently lower than the general population.

Furthermore, looking at the highest degree recieved, there is a pattern of women and minorities holding a much higher degree at the time of selection.

This suggests that there may be some biases in the selection process that manifest as women and racial/ethnic minorities needing higher educational qualifications to be chosen. I am doing a deeper analysis of applicant data from 2009 and 2013 to see if these patterns hold in the larger applicant pool.
